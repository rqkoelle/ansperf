# ANS Performance

This Project has been set up to provide tools for the analysis
performance of air navigation services (ANS).

It is also a feasibility study to explore the use of R/RStudio
and github for the development of the material, version control, and sharing this information with interested stakeholders.

As the insights grow, the structure of this repo will evolve.
